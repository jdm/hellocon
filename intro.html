<p>Hello, Con! is comprised of a series of lightning talks given by selected speakers, each for around 10 minutes. The talks should be related to programming and computer science, but are otherwise unrestricted in terms of topic and form. Speakers are encouraged to share their personal stories, ongoing or completed projects, work experience, research results, or even future visions regarding the field of programming or computer science in a broader context. </p>

<p>Speakers will specify topics through online proposals, and will be selected through a completely anonymous process by the committee formed by IEEE UofT and Mozilla. While these short speeches are the main component of the conference, there are also networking sessions where participants and speakers are free to further discuss talk topics and develop connections. For a more structured view of the event, the following provides a rough outline:</p>

<p>Our purpose is to provide a platform for sharing interesting programming experiences and ideas, expose participants to the human experience of being software developers, and above all, foster and extend the passion for computer science/computer engineering.</p>
