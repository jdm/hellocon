            <h1>About IEEE University of Toronto</h1>
            <p>The IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch is the leading technical and professional development club for UofTâ€™s engineering students. We aim to foster student interest in the field of computer and electrical technologies, and to provide
                them with more insights into the respective industry and academic scenes. We offer many opportunities for students to develop their technical and professional skills through our competitions and hackathons, industry tours, talks and seminars,
                and more.</p>

            <h1>Hello, Con!</h1>
            <p>Hello, Con! is a conference at University of Toronto comprised of a series of lightning talks given by selected speakers. The talks are related to programming and computer science, but are otherwise unrestricted in terms of topic and form.
                Speakers are going to share their personal stories, ongoing or completed projects, work experience, research results, or even future visions regarding the field of programming or computer science in a broader context. We welcome all Computer
                Science and Engineering students as well as any developers from related industry fields who are interested. </p>
