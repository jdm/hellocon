# Website for Hello, Con
## Notable technical features
- highly static: Use javascript only for data rendering. Keep the website as static as possible to optimize speed of first load
- csv parse: use [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com/) library to parse csv (generated by google forms) into JSON, and then rendered dynamically. This makes updating speakers information extremely effortless.
- HTML Template based rendering: data of speakers loaded asynchronously and rendered with templates. This boosts initial loading.
- Interactive canlendar: inspired by [Frosh](https://www.orientation.skule.ca/) to build a beautifully interactive calendar for the schedule page
