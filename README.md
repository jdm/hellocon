# Website for Hello, Con!
## Notable Design Features
- highly static: Use JavaScript mostly for data rendering. Minimize the use of JavaScript for styling. Keep the website as static as possible to optimize speed of first load
- csv parse: use [Papa Parse](http://papaparse.com/) library to parse csv (generated by google forms) into JSON, and then rendered dynamically. This makes updating speakers information extremely effortless.
- HTML Template based rendering: data of speakers loaded asynchronously and rendered with templates. This boosts initial loading.
- Interactive canlendar: inspired by [Frosh](https://www.orientation.skule.ca/) to build a beautifully interactive calendar for the schedule page
- Modal: Code of Conduct page is built with a modal to ensure focused reading
- Compability: due to compability issues (especially for some Android integrated browsers and old version of iOS), ES5 standard is used.
- Optimized first-load: minified css, inline important css and jss to reduce requests.
- Optimized images: use webp for chrome, use png otherwise
