# Code of Conduct

Hello, Con! is dedicated to offering the programming community in the Greater Toronto Area an opportunity to teach, learn and **have fun**! To provide a good experience for everyone, we feel that it is necessary for participants/attendees to follow the following code of conduct. 

We ask that every attendee of the conference behave professionally during the conference. Any actions and statements based on ideas of discrimination and inequality of any kind are not allowed.

Harassment includes offensive statement topics include but are not limited to the following topics are not allowed:

1. Gender and sexual orientation

2. Disability

3. Physical appearance

4. Race, culture and national origin

5. Religion and creed

6. Ancestry

7. Age

Inappropriate actions include but are not limited to the following topics are not allowed:

1. Displaying disturbing images in public spaces

2. Deliberate intimidation

3. Stalking

4. Photography or recording without consent

5. Sustained disruption of talks or other events

6. Inappropriate physical contact

7. Unwelcome sexual attention

Attendees who are asked to end their inappropriate actions and comments, even when they are unintentional, should immediately comply with this code of conduct.

For attendees violating any of the above, the IEEE UofT committee will take actions that we deem appropriate, ranging from verbal warnings/exclusion from the conference to the involvement of the relevant authorities.

**Social Rules**

We hereby present a set of suggestions that we found from the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) for any social engagement during the conference. We believe that this set of suggestions will improve everyone's socializing experience. All attendees are encouraged to keep the following social rules in mind when making new friends at the conference!

Social Rules: [https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules)

The suggestions provided here, compared to the previous section of code of conduct that are to be strictly followed by attendees, are much more informal. The violation of such suggestions will not result in any actions taken against them by the conference organizers. However, it is still strongly encouraged that people learn about them and follow them whenever possible (not only at the Hello, Con!).
